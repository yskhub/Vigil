# Phase 06 — Finalization & Demo Walkthrough

Status: Planned

Goals:
- End-to-end demo: detection → agent engagement → extraction → GUVI callback.
- Prepare demo script and example sessions for evaluation.
- Prepare final submission artifacts and README.

Planned steps:
1. Run evaluation flows against GUVI test messages.
2. Record sample session transcripts and metrics.
3. Package demo and provide runbook.

Acceptance criteria:
- Final callback successfully sent to GUVI for at least one session.
- Demo script demonstrates agent effectiveness and extracted intelligence.
