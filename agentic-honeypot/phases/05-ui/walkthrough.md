# Phase 05 — UI Walkthrough

Status: Planned

Goals:
- Build a React-based UI for monitoring sessions and extracted intelligence.
- Provide session actions: re-run extractor, mark false positive, and trigger GUVI callback.

Planned steps:
1. Scaffold `ui/` using Vite + React.
2. Implement API client with `x-api-key` support.
3. Implement session list, session detail views, and settings page.

Acceptance criteria:
- Minimal UI showing active sessions and extraction results.
- UI can trigger the final GUVI callback when appropriate.
