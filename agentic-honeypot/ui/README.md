Agentic Honey-Pot — Static UI

This is a minimal static demo UI that can be hosted on GitHub Pages.

Usage:
- Edit `index.html` to set `apiUrl` and `apiKey` or use the defaults.
- Serve locally with any static server, or push to `gh-pages` via the provided workflow.

This UI is intentionally minimal to avoid build steps or paid hosting.
