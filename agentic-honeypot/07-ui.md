# 07 — UI Phase

## Purpose
Provide a lightweight UI for monitoring sessions, viewing extracted intelligence, and manually intervening in engagements.

## Pages
- Dashboard: active sessions summary, totals, health.
- Session view: conversation transcript, extracted intelligence, agent notes, action buttons (re-run extractor, mark as false positive, trigger callback).
- Settings: API keys, retention, thresholds.

## Tech Stack (suggested)
- Frontend: React + Vite (fast), Tailwind for styling.
- Backend: Reuse the FastAPI app for API endpoints.

## Minimum Viable UI (MVP)
- Simple session list showing `sessionId`, `scamDetected`, `totalMessagesExchanged`.
- Clicking a session shows the conversationHistory and extracted intelligence with copy buttons.

## Next steps to implement UI
1. Scaffold React app under `ui/`.
2. Add a simple component to call `GET /sessions/:id` (prototype endpoint to implement server-side).
3. Wire API key authentication in the UI for actions.
4. Add basic styling and demo data.

## Ethics
- Mask sensitive pieces (e.g., show last 4 digits only) in logs and UI by default.
